As a newbee in the Devops world, I took my time to learn the basics of tools and tried to practice them with hands-on expamples 
In this project I took a simple nodejs app and tried to practice Docker and Kubernetes by doing the following:

-First I used Docker build to containerize the app.
-I installed kubernetes from the Docker Desktop 
-Launched a cluster and deployed a pod 'pod' from the previous container
-As expected the web page was nor accessible 
-Deployed a service 'svc-local' and now the web page is accessible
-Created a node with 5 pods useing a Deploy script
-Lastly created a scripted to make sure the node is up to date
